## Objective

Please create a program executable from the command line that when given text(s) will return 100 of most common three word sequences in descending order of frequency.

## Installation and Running Application

This project utilizes [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for convenience in building and running the application. Additionally, the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) (`gradlew`) will handle downloading the Gradle runtime, so you won't need to install Gradle ahead of time.

### Prerequisites

Java JDK or JRE version 11 or higher must be installed. To check, run `java -version`:
Please check java version by running `java -version`
```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "11" 2018-09-25

```

### Build Project

```bash

# local setup
 Extract the given zip into your local using the below command in your gitbash.
 unzip newrelic-code-exercise.zip -d newrelic-code-exercise


# Build Application 
cd newrelic-code-exercise
./gradlew build
```

### Running the application with `gradlew run` ( preferred method )

```bash
# Runs the main method from App.java with the supplied file
./gradlew run --args='moby-dick.txt'

```

Output:

```bash
Enter the file name to be processed:
moby-dick.txt
Given file name is:moby-dick.txt

## Running Tests

```bash
cd newrelic-code-exercise

./gradlew test

```

## What you do if you have given more time

I would look for more different ways to implement the solution.
I would like to work on containerization.

## What are the potential bugs

The input file provided moby-dick.txt has a different apostrophe (â€™) which I replaced with (').

## Notes
The program is taking around 600 milliseconds in our computer.
